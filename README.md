## Running the Project

You need to clone [this project](https://app.graphcms.com/clone/d1864e9892d44564950fa4d4d8905e44?name=Ignite%20Lab%20-%20Andreia%20Souza) in order to get all data needed to run the app.
Once cloned, go to your project settings/api-access to get your content api url and create your own permanent auth token.

After that, you'll need to create a .env.local in your root folder with the following environment variables, using your content api url and auth token

 ```cl
VITE_API_URL =
VITE_API_ACCESS_TOKEN =
```
You can use **npm install** to install all dependencies.
After that, just initialize the project.

```cl
npm run dev
```
